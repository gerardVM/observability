# Observability (Grafana Cloud)

I am sharing my Observability setup in Grafana Cloud.

- Dashboards are created/imported using json files at setups/{team}/dashboards
- Alerting rules are created/imported using yaml files at setups/{team}/alerting/evaluations
- Contacts are handled by setups/{team}/alerting/contacts.yaml
